/*

Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game.
Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green',
'yellow', or 'red'.

• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green.
If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that
fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

// Define the variable alien_color and assign it a value
var alien_color = 'green';
// Check if the alien's color is green
if (alien_color === 'green') {
    // If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points
    console.log("The player just earned 5 points.");
}
// Assigning different values to alien_color
alien_color = 'yellow';
// Check if the alien's color is green
if (alien_color === 'green') {
    // If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points
